# Getting Started with Next.js and Markdown

Welcome to my first blog post! This demonstrates how easy it is to create blog content with Markdown.

## Why Markdown?

Markdown is simple, portable, and perfect for blog content. Here are some benefits:

- Easy to write and read
- Version controlled with Git
- No complex CMS needed
- Perfect table support!

## Table Example

| Framework | Language   | Best For        |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| Next.js   | JavaScript | Full-stack apps |
| React     | JavaScript | UI Components   |
| Vue       | JavaScript | Progressive web |

## Code Example
```javascript
const fetchBlogPosts = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/blogs');
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
};
```

## Conclusion

Markdown makes blogging simple and efficient. No more CMS headaches!
