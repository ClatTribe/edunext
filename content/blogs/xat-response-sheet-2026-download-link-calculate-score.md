# XAT Response Sheet 2026: Download & Calculate Score

XAT response sheet 2026 will be released by XLRI Jamshedpur. The XAT response sheet 2026 is expected to be released in January 2026. The XAT answer key and 2026 response sheet will be available in online mode at xatonline.in. Candidates will be able to download the XAT 2026 response sheet using their login credentials.

The XAT Exam Response Sheet is the most crucial response sheet for those who have appeared in the XAT 2026 exam, because it contains marked answers of each and every candidate during the test. However, the examination authority also provides the XAT Answer Key for all questions where the correct official answer is also provided. Students may download the XAT Answer Key from the official site of XAT to cross-check with correct solutions and calculate scores.
